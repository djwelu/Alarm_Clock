This is the Critical labs internship submission for Dustin Welu.

Instructions:
First, on the command line in the backend folder, use "node index.js" to start backend to run on localhost.
Second, in a new terminal in the frontend folder, use "yarn start" (or npm) to start the front end on local host.

This project does not include a database but rather the alarm times are hard coded in the backend. 
This is not something I would do in a real project but reaches requirements of this project.
This project still properly displays my ability to integrate a frontend and backend without a database.
